# Automatically approve PRs made by Dependabot
#
# Written to look at the original author of the PR (instead of the current
# actor) in order to be able to backresolve existing PRs using this action (by
# mass labeling them). Leads to slightly unnecessary spammage of aprovals in a
# PR...
#
# Only does approvals! A different GitHub Action takes care of merging.
